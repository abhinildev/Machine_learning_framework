## Overview

This repository contains a custom machine learning framework implemented using the Python programming language.

All algorithms are implemented from scratch with a focus on understanding the mathematical foundations, optimization techniques, and internal mechanics of machine learning models.

The following algorithms are implemented or planned:

### Supervised Learning
1. Linear Regression  
2. Decision Trees  
3. Logistic Regression  
4. Linear SVM (Hard Margin & Soft Margin)  
5. Kernel SVM (Hard Margin & Soft Margin)  
6. Naive Bayes  
7. Random Forest  
8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
9. Simple One-Layer Perceptron  
10. Multi-Layer Perceptron (ANN)  
11. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
12. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  

### Unsupervised Learning
13. K-Means Clustering  
14. Gaussian Mixture Model (Expectation Maximization)  
15. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  

In addition to model implementations, this framework includes custom mathematical components such as loss functions, optimization algorithms, evaluation metrics, and utility functions located in the `core` module.

Testing and validation are handled through the `tests` directory using sanity checks and behavior-based testing.

## Tech Stack

### Python Libraries
- **NumPy** – Primary numerical computation and linear algebra library  
- **Pandas** – Data handling and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization and plotting  

High-level machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are intentionally not used.
