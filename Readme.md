### Overview
This is a custom framework for machine learning made using Python programming language.Here we will be implementing the follwing algorithms:
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Decision Trees
    3. Logistic Regression
    4. Linear SVM(hard margin + soft margin)
    5. Kernel SVM(hard margin + soft margin)
    6. Naive Bayes
    7. Random Forest
    8. KNN
    9. K-means
    10. Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation maximisation 
    11. Simple one layer perceptron
    12. Multi layer perceptron model (ANN)
    13. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    14. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    15. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Even outside of this, I will be implementing custom math functions like losses, optimisations and others present in the core folder. The testing will be done by the test folder and its respective functions.
### Tech stack:
